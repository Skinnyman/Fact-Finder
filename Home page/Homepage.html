                          <a href="#"><b>John Spencer</b></a> (1935-2006) was an English <a href="#">snooker</a> player. He<br> reached the final 
                          of the <a href="#">English Amateur Championship</a> three<br> years in a row, winning on his third attempt in 1966. 
                          After turning<br> professional in 1967, he won the <a href="#">World Snooker Championship</a><br> as a debutant <a href="#">in 1969</a>. 
                          He won his second world title in the <a href="#">1971 <br> event</a>. 
                          His third, in 1977, made him the first player to win at <br> Sheffield's <a href="#">Crucible Theatre</a> where 
                          the event has been staged <br> annually ever since. His other notable victories include the 1975 <br>Masters, 
                          where he defeated Ray Reardon on a re-spotted black<br> in the deciding frame of the final, the 1978 
                          Irish Masters, and<br> three editions of the BBCs Pot Black series. He was a snooker <br> commentator for 
                          the BBC from 1978 to 1998, and served on <br>the board of
                          <a href="#">the World Professional Billiards and Snooker</a><br> Association for 25 years, the last 7 of those as chair. 
                          He retired<br> from professional play in 1992 because of ill health, <br>but continued to perform in <a href="#">exhibition matches</a> 
                          . The trophy for the <br>Seniors Masters tournament was named in his memory in 2018.<br>

                It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, including the <br>

                <br> Channel, at depths of up to 250 m (820 ft). It has a wide <br>

                photographed in the Atlantic <br> Ocean in <a href="#">Arråbida Natural Park</a>, Portugal.
